# Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity. 
Capstone Project

## Project Overview

This Project started by a personal interest, the TCG (Trading Card Game) is getting immensly big,
a lot of Youtubers and more propably played a huge part in this.
my foxus went onto magic the Gathering, while it maybe doesnt have the biggest data sets, it stil contains some pretty hefty prices
and i looked at those.


## Quick Start
    bash:
    1. cd (to the folder that was just downloaded)
    
    ->
    2. Ive put the csv Files into a Zip-Archive since they are too big to upload, so please unzip them to continue
    3. python ETL.py

    Now u can see Data being cleaned searched for NAN values and duplicates, it cleans them and then prints out barcharts i found interestingf for my purpose
    if wanted we can update the csv files anytime, im planning on downloading it automaticly but this is beyond my capibilities atm.
